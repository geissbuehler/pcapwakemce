This tool tries to solve the problem disussed in http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/t/7802.aspx. PcapWakeMCE uses WinPcap to listen for packets sent out by the extender and sends a Wake on LAN packet for the Mediacenter PC if the extender has been seen on the network. Packets are received in WinPcap's promiscuous mode and filtered by the MAC address of the extender to match any packet sent by the extender.
Currently it has only been compiled and tested under Windows with WinPcap but it may also work with the pcap libary under Linux. It's mainly based on sample code from the [WinPcap Developer's Packs](http://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm). To run PcapWakeMCE [WinPcap](http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm) must be installed.
